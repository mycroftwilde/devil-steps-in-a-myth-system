### The Artist

Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told that it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really. 

##

#### About my writing and a quick preface: 

##

I think in Images, and Scenes, Feeling, in Emotion, and Texture, in Rythme... and, maybe even in Color... that one is recent, and I can't tell if I'm learning to read it or I'm projecting, it's probably a bit of both. I'm, generally speaking, incredible sensitive. I've been told before that I'm an empath. That was cool. 

If I'm tired and someone tells me something alarming, and then my brain "has" to think about it, it puts the scene in my mind and it can cause viseral reactions, like I'm there or feeling what the person could have felt from what I was told. 

I would imagine that may be attention related, along with my sensitivity ... try to concentrate on the road while driving in fog before? something like that. 

I'm articulate and smart, I've spent alot of time thinking and learning, and learning about how to be understood by others, or, to get my point accross, but ... and this is a BIG "but" ... BUT ... my attention is trash... BAD-BAD... unless something grabs it. And, for me, most of the time, the world is gray. It's boring. I do think that at one point it was probably brighter with... wonder(?) so many things to look into, or understand, the desire to touch my toes into the pools of possibility, but, that's all I had too, and for so many years now it's been more gray than I knew how to say.   

I felt like... starting here, this way, may be the best way to get a feel for how I describe things before you should read the story of some of the events that helped shape me... well, at least from the perseptive of this "current-self" of mine. 

I'm also writing this ...idk, "sudo-live," I guess, as an antiperfectionist exersize for myself.

#### Topics:

##

General Topics will include my Backstory, My Mental Health Issues (Social and General Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, ADHD, Traits of OCD, and a lifetime of Depression that I didn't know existed, My once completely toxic reality lens born from a religiously cult-like toxic dogmatic style of worldview in upbringing/household, world vs us and all that ..., social abuse from my peers and bullies that would then see me isolated from any sort of ...normal socialization, I guess, and, unfortunatly, this was all included with my capability to adjust ... to ... hold on ... to ... "make do" ... until the very edge of what I could handle, and then more ...

When you fear death more than the depression of life, and living is actually painful, and grey, dull, and lifeless, it's more than you can properly understand or articulate, because it's all you ever saw or felt? idk, you learn to adjust. Steal the smallest moment of happy ... when you could get it, and then just ... be ... until you could get it again. The mind is a powerful thing.  I also learned that when you look into Hell ... Hell looks back ... it's one *ahem* Hell *ahem* of a rough experience ... *crickets*... okay... Okay, Okay... I tried right? *bow* ... right... moving on... I can feel that tension cut from here haha, let's all just calm a bit... it's just rough topic shit ... AND... just like the big "but", this is a big "AND" ... And, There is ... something beautiful about all this for me ... our hells are just that ... well, not "just" anything ... but, they are OUR Hells ... just like our reality is self-definited, in a sense,... well, in the same sense, our hell is the same ... And, luckily, it means that for each us, when we are in OUR Hells, we can know that WE are actually in control. Or, at least, we have more direct agency that we expct we do in those moments...years(?)

#### Trauma Background:

This was pulled from a conversation I had regarding my PTSD, and edited for the purpose of placing it here. I'm noting that, as the tone of the writing will change for this part. 

So ... may as well start at the beginning... *gets dusty book down from the top shelf and blows the dust off*
hahaha
So I grew up in a .. self idenfied "christian" household ... roughly thinking, you can use baptist or weaslian in your head, it's analogous enough.
The house I grew up in has/had this ... us vs them mentality in worldview. There is the "them" and there is the "saved." This was initially how Reality was divided up for me. 

The purpose of reality is being "saved." Everything else comes after that, it's the "mission" in life, in a sense. Not in a militant sense, well, I suppose depending on your definition, but in a more "loving" sense, but, it was unfortunatly toxically so... 

This is gonna build from alot of stuff that's probably gonna seem dissperse but seems relevant in the build of the image, since it all ties together
Growing up.. my dad met my mom when he was ... 34? I think, she was 19-20, they have a 15 year difference, was at a music event or something for the church. 

Mom was enamored and pursed the shy AF and also with social trauma, dad.

I think they had me, I'd say when dad was near 40, I wanna say? something like that

So, they have me and my brother, who is 2 years younger.

Alot of my ptsd comes back to social trauma, and the Fawning response built from other social ptsd I had in trauma.  Like one trauma on other. 


  - A Rough Definition for Fawning responses is this: 
"Fawning is a trauma response where a person develops people-pleasing behaviors to avoid conflict and to establish a sense of safety. In other words, the fawn trauma response is a type of coping mechanism that survivors of complex trauma adopt to "appease" their abusers."1

So, the stuff from childhood is like this -

We were put into a small private "Christian" "School" of about 30 people. (Quotes seperate on purpose...) up until about grade 3, that wasn't great from a socialization perspective, but, it became worse, with the overarching view of reality being given and without a grounding so far, but we swapped to public school in grade 4

About half way thru grade 4 I became like.. you see all those kids who are bullied in school from the movies...

I had it worse...

it was bad, bad... 

I often don't think about it but think about an entire social level, being kids my age, deciding I was .... lowest rung, almost always?

I was made of for ...being tall (? lmfao) for reacting to being emotionally hurt, for being physically hurt, for my last name (prins, being turned into princess to mock me with)

At recess I used to have to  follow the teachers, or keep them in eyeline (Remember, this happened for YEARS...)

Otherwise it would be potentially dangerous, I could get beat up or hurt

We lived close to the school, so we walked... Some of the bully kids did too, well, hell, alot of them did... 

It meant leaving my house or being ... out and about, thinking back now, felt dangerous, I think, always watching, having to be careful, always nervous... 

This was grade 4 - 8, the end of elementry school,  until I hit highschool in grade 9 ...  it was ... horrible

I also .. almost died in grade 4. 

They had this "hotdog" day. Teachers back then walked the hallways and checked on classrooms.

I choked... a bully of mine, a friend from before things shifted, saved my life by doing the hemlick ... which he learned from baywatch, of all things... that must have been complicated to feel. A bully literally saving my life, my parents view of what reality was, almost touching "death" so early and their nonsense and toxic beliefs... 

There was another time... peggys cove... I went too close to the edge, slipped. I can't remember how young. I Held onto the edge until my dad was able to get me

There was almost dying of croup when I was a kid due to being alergic to penecilin. 

I felt afraid of my dad dying, because he was older.. his dad - my grandfather,... died on my fathers 17th birthday in his 50s
