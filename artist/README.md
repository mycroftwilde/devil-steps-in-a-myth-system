### The Artist

##

Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told that it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really.
