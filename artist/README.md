### The Artist

##

Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told that it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really. 

However, there are things in here that ARE triggering to others... If you are dealing with depression in a heavy way, suicidal thoughts, etc, please be aware this WILL be triggering I would not recommend reading this. If you do, please do it after all the art is completed so that you see the healing that comes with this. Don't go into something without seeing the head tunnel completely defined, at least in regards to something like this.

#### About my writing and a quick preface: 

##

I think in Images, and Scenes, Feeling, in Emotion, and Texture, in Rythme... and, maybe even in Color... that one is recent, and I can't tell if I'm learning to read it or I'm projecting, it's probably a bit of both. I'm, generally speaking, incredible sensitive. I've been told before that I'm an empath. That was cool. 

If I'm tired and someone tells me something alarming, and then my brain "has" to think about it, it puts the scene in my mind and it can cause viseral reactions, like I'm there or feeling what the person could have felt from what I was told. 

I would imagine that may be attention related, along with my sensitivity ... try to concentrate on the road while driving in fog before? something like that. 

I'm articulate and smart, I've spent alot of time thinking and learning, and learning about how to be understood by others, or, to get my point accross, but ... and this is a BIG "but" ... BUT ... my attention is trash... BAD-BAD... unless something grabs it. And, for me, most of the time, the world is gray. It's boring. I do think that at one point it was probably brighter with... wonder(?) so many things to look into, or understand, the desire to touch my toes into the pools of possibility, but, that's all I had too, and for so many years now it's been more gray than I knew how to say.   

I felt like... starting here, this way, may be the best way to get a feel for how I describe things before you should read the story of some of the events that helped shape me... well, at least from the perseptive of this "current-self" of mine. 

I'm also writing this ...idk, "sudo-live," I guess, as an antiperfectionist exersize for myself. 

##

#### Topics:

##

General Topics will include my Backstory, My Mental Health Issues (Social and General Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, ADHD, Traits of OCD, and a lifetime of Depression that I didn't know existed, My once completely toxic reality lens born from a religiously cult-like toxic dogmatic style of worldview in upbringing/household, world vs us and all that ..., social abuse from my peers and bullies that would then see me isolated from any sort of ...normal socialization, I guess, and, unfortunatly, this was all included with my capability to adjust ... to ... hold on ... to ... "make do" ... until the very edge of what I could handle, and then more ...

When you fear death more than the depression of life, and living is actually painful, and grey, dull, and lifeless, it's more than you can properly understand or articulate, because it's all you ever saw or felt? idk, you learn to adjust. Steal the smallest moment of happy ... when you could get it, and then just ... be ... until you could get it again. The mind is a powerful thing.  I also learned that when you look into Hell ... Hell looks back ... it's one *ahem* Hell *ahem* of a rough experience ... *crickets*... okay... Okay, Okay... I tried right? *bow* ... right... moving on... I can feel that tension cut from here haha, let's all just calm a bit... it's just rough topic shit ... AND... just like the big "but", this is a big "AND" ... And, There is ... something beautiful about all this for me ... our hells are just that ... well, not "just" anything ... but, they are OUR Hells ... just like our reality is self-definited, in a sense,... well, in the same sense, our hell is the same ... And, luckily, it means that for each us, when we are in OUR Hells, we can know that WE are actually in control. Or, at least, we have more direct agency that we expct we do in those moments...years(?)

#### Trauma Background Stories: 

##

This was pulled from a conversation I had regarding my PTSD, and edited for the purpose of placing it here. I'm noting that, as the tone of the writing will change for this part. 

So ... may as well start at the beginning... *gets dusty book down from the top shelf and blows the dust off*
hahaha
So I grew up in a .. self idenfied "christian" household ... roughly thinking, you can use baptist or weaslian in your head, it's analogous enough.
The house I grew up in has/had this ... us vs them mentality in worldview. There is the "them" and there is the "saved." This was initially how Reality was divided up for me. 

The purpose of reality is being "saved." Everything else comes after that, it's the "mission" in life, in a sense. Not in a militant sense, well, I suppose depending on your definition, but in a more "loving" sense, but, it was unfortunatly toxically so... 

This is gonna build from alot of stuff that's probably gonna seem dissperse but seems relevant in the build of the image, since it all ties together
Growing up.. my dad met my mom when he was ... 34? I think, she was 19-20, they have a 15 year difference, was at a music event or something for the church. 

Mom was enamored and pursed the shy AF and also with social trauma, dad.

I think they had me, I'd say when dad was near 40, I wanna say? something like that

So, they have me and my brother, who is 2 years younger.

Alot of my ptsd comes back to social trauma, and the Fawning response built from other social ptsd I had in trauma.  Like one trauma on other. 


  - A Rough Definition for Fawning responses is this: 
"Fawning is a trauma response where a person develops people-pleasing behaviors to avoid conflict and to establish a sense of safety. In other words, the fawn trauma response is a type of coping mechanism that survivors of complex trauma adopt to "appease" their abusers."1

So, the stuff from childhood is like this -

We were put into a small private "Christian" "School" of about 30 people. (Quotes seperate on purpose...) up until about grade 3, that wasn't great from a socialization perspective, but, it became worse, with the overarching view of reality being given and without a grounding so far, but we swapped to public school in grade 4

About half way thru grade 4 I became like.. you see all those kids who are bullied in school from the movies...

I had it worse...

it was bad, bad... 

I often don't think about it but think about an entire social level, being kids my age, deciding I was .... lowest rung, almost always?

I was made of for ...being tall (? lmfao) for reacting to being emotionally hurt, for being physically hurt, for my last name (prins, being turned into princess to mock me with)

At recess I used to have to  follow the teachers, or keep them in eyeline (Remember, this happened for YEARS...)

Otherwise it would be potentially dangerous, I could get beat up or hurt

We lived close to the school, so we walked... Some of the bully kids did too, well, hell, alot of them did... 

It meant leaving my house or being ... out and about, thinking back now, felt dangerous, I think, always watching, having to be careful, always nervous... 

This was grade 4 - 8, the end of elementry school,  until I hit highschool in grade 9 ...  it was ... horrible

I also .. almost died in grade 4. 

They had this "hotdog" day. Teachers back then walked the hallways and checked on classrooms.

I choked... a bully of mine, a friend from before things shifted, saved my life by doing the hemlick ... which he learned from baywatch, of all things... that must have been complicated to feel. A bully literally saving my life, my parents view of what reality was, almost touching "death" so early and their nonsense and toxic beliefs... 

There was another time... peggys cove... I went too close to the edge, slipped. I can't remember how young. I Held onto the edge until my dad was able to get me

There was almost dying of croup when I was a kid due to being alergic to penecilin. 

I felt afraid of my dad dying, because he was older.. his dad - my grandfather,... died on my fathers 17th birthday in his 50s

That sort of potential lose, and a lose that was ... potentially close ... due to when they had me, and me being me ... I coddled my father... I held back, or was always sort of afraid of that I could cause him to have a heart attack? or the stress? ... anyways, the reason that was all important is with not ever feeling safe, always looking at death, "be right with god" and like me trying to drill down and no one giving me the answer that never satisfied anything ... with the social PTSD and not being safe ... I developed something like the fawning response (See above definition) 

Authority figures, bosses, like I could feel that change in dominance hierachy because it then affected me.. my worth or saftey or w/e, was all tied up in the environement

The places in control of me needed to be okay, or safe or happy, or w/e, there was subconcious weight in a room, me watching for that or making sure things were okay

And, again, me being me... like, I've been told all my life that I'm smart...  "teachers said you were a genius" whatever the f*** that means... it never sunk it... like how can you respect the opinion when it comes from teachers who don't know how to teach? or how to actually handle children properly? or to actually protect me? People could have told me that till they were blue in the face, but they didn't really have a leg to stand on from the perspective of assessment, and it was obvious.  So, to me, it always felt like it was a short cut answer for the things they couldn't handle or didn't want to put the work into. 

but shit isn't ... hard for me either... not really, like I haven't been able to put my mind to something I couldn't figure out eventually... or at least try? BUT, to get me engaged was sooooooooo hard. I would say almost impossible. Things were too easy. 

when I was in the dentist chair recently, just as a side thought... it was getting dark outside. Lights from above, but it's glass all around the chair

and it's dark and I, when I wasn't medicated with stimulants, I'd feel that sort of change and it would give me a sort of sadness, it happened alot when I was younger, but I was soooo sensitive to shit because I never was ... alive, I guess and always just hiding from pain, or my thoughts, or worries

anyways, to continue along this hanging lantern trail hahah

I guess, I should mention the other worries I had when I was younger, I remember for months at a time having these

fears

it was worse at night, the days were better

but it would be like

I'd find a lump on my chest

and I'd think it was cancer

couldn't talk about it, didn't want to think about death or know what to do, and at night it was like just this huuuuge feeling of dread and fear and just trying to get away from it and be happy for a little while

that happend alot, it was probably tied to the fears of death and me being told all that other shit and my view of reality being fucked 

anyways, so we get to highschool and things get a little better

the shift in social groups, add in some groups, take away from other groups

It helped me dissappear from being the main focus of being punchable or fuckwithable lol

the later years were better

and I took another year in highschool cause ... to get me engaged or to care was rooooooooooooough, neeeded to recomplete a few courses cause stuff just wasn't done lol

but I remember that last year being better

the kids my age

the ones that the fears were with maybe but that year felt a little better

now near the end of highschool I start having panic attacks

I was dating a girl at the time, Let's call her GF1, and all the religious shit, expectiations I'd imagine, unhealthy views of soooo much shit... and the relationship wasn't working.. I stopped caring as much, couldn't see it as much.. remember losing my erection during sex once and me being like "WTF is happening!" and then that becoming an anxiety... or wait, no I was working at the accounting firm, after I finished college. GF1 and I started dating at the end of highschool

This fawning shit is still going on without me know and my sytem and what my reality was telling me, etc, and I'm probably just a leaf in the wind of depression and anxiety, and I don't ... like I didn't really care about anything as a focus, because that develops when your sort of baselined.. I never was. Anyway... 

GF1 and I break up, life continues and we can probably skip a few years and another relationship until I'm living in north bay, working IT for a company and living by myself.. been having anxiety and depression issues. Back into religion to understand the world again and I'm losing my f***ing mind just trying to ... understand reality.. in a sense of "how can I be okay, what is saved, what do I need to do"

I'm not masturbating at this time too, no sex,

There is a reason I'm bringing that up, besides just being blanket honest.  There is a pattern I noticed recently with that and when I have my panic attacks, or the panic attacks that aren't specifically tied to a source of stress

it seems when I'm not having sex, or engaged in that system, and because my parents... like so... my parents never dealt with sex. It was sort of a ... conversation I don't ever remember having besides "don't have it before marriage."

 They were so focused on that. Mom used to "tsk" when nudity came on the screen if we watched a movie.... lmfao - think about an animal having a reaction everytime they feel a feeling and external stimulie comes in... anyways .. like it was to the point when I was dating GF1 they didn't have ... doors on our bedrooms

it was fucked from that degree, but that was "normal" ... not that it stopped me...

 So, the sexual side of human nature... that system wasn't... normalized ... an undercurrent of anxiety followed me I had to pull apart from every other angle because... reality was "x, not y" *eye roll* (a -sexual wife after, to hang a lantern on that)

so the company I was working for at that time, after I gave up on religion again had an office out in Moncton

a friend of mine was like "there is this girl you gotta meet"

was my wife, I flew out, I moved up a month later

now this company I worked for

that when I stopped working I had been working at for one month shy of 10 years

I had been on this on-call rotation

this job sort of by it's absense in actual management, allowed me to not prioritize myself and I drove myself into the group. People hung jobs in front of me

to get me to ... encourage me to continue the work and level of shit I'd do

when I was in north bay, which was about 2 years... I was essentially alone. they never had offsite staff in my department before. They have a main office in London and North bay was a satalite office. So I was left to sort of "speak for myself" because management was non existant... except it wasn't

my boss at the time I think I looked up to because of the fawning response, or that is the say, the priortization in what I would here would be weighted different in my perception. 

he never did his job, I did so much of it over the years. I wasn't help, and the only thing I knew how to do was keep working to trying to make it better

it got worse and worse

I remember some weeks, while being on-call ... barely sleeping and then the phone would ring again... just wanting to sleep so badly... feeling so alone... I remember being told the entirty of the team I worked with in london came in late and left early, while I probably stayed late and never left early, or would get anxiety because I was walking this invisible "line" that didn't exist beside in my head

got to the point where I was doing like... 75% of the work in the main area of our group... 

no actual management and me just going further and further and further into what I had seen from childhood

not being seen, being disregarded, trying to handle things the way I knew how

I got a job eventually at a higher position within the same company and the guy I had been close with, the other person in the group I moved into, changed completely...it was all fucked... the boss at the time knew shit was going on, didn't know how to deal with conflict, how to really resolve or help things or even just go "let's get on a call and talk this out, cause WTF is happening, Guy, stop being a fucking child" ... the other guys excuse was "I'm not a teacher" ... and it's like "yeah, but you aren't a co-worker either, I guess? or, how about all the years I did extra work for you because we were both frustrated by ineptitude?"... and I was the most known quanitity to ever hit that group. I had to pull shit apart and figure some things out. Didn't know I had adhd at the time, and was too ... alone. I couldn't orient, I guess. That job change happend right before covid hit

I also didn't know then that I was a ... visual person? There was no way to bring me to london while covid was happening to even show me what the server room looked like. I was working from abstractions and information. The ... job change was like "here is the old guys notes, go read that"

that on-call rotation changed from one week at a time, 24 hours a day, all 7 days of the week , every 4-5 weeks, depending upon how many staff we had, to every 2 weeks

I remember getting a call once, and my brain flodded, exhausted, I didn't have the info I needed to orient and just howled in tears "I don't know what to do!"

all I had to do was call my boss and ask a quick question, or even a co-worker

but all the shit was setup so badly that it was ... fucked when I was tired. And, being told almost by that fawning response, or my own trauma, when I could sleep

when I couldn't function already without sleep...10 years of that shit, over and over again, being gaslit and the cycle continuing... 

on top of that

And to keep in mind, my Ex-Wife and I are still friends and live together, but this needs to be talked about too. We are working on healing, but to disregard this is ... wrong, in the grand scope of what I'm trying to do now. 

My Ex-Wife and I slept in the same room, but seperate beds, pushed together .. I wanted to sleep in the same bed... she always used the reason of "how expense her matress is and how she needs to be tucked in a certain way" to quote her reasons. 

so, when I was bigger than I am now,  I was diagosed with sleep apnea and was stressed and messed all the time, and couldn't think thru using the machine before sleep alot

My Ex-Wife would hit me sometimes, push me, whatever it took to wake me up, if I was snoring

so I could move to the couch

that ... on a long enough timeline with all the sleeping issues... she never moved to the couch herself. She eventually, or we both did, subconciously adjusted in little ways, but I was the one moving to change myself again.

I felt isolated

like I was being pushed and shoved down, and I "just wanted her to do that once so I felt supported" or something like that
then my larger cat, who we got to help with depression - dexter. He wasn't socialized properly and we didn't know enough when we first got him... so he's dude cat agressive sometimes, likes to play. He's also 30 pounds and moves like a tiger. He makes this sound that's so... hash... when he wants attention. I work from home and didn't have anywhere else to go

He cut has back leg open a few months after getting him and that sound was the thing that made me come running when it happened. He's done it ever since and it hurts me viserally, to hear it. 
 
then add on the sex issues with my Ex-Wife, or lack of sex, and the need I have.. . like as near as far as I can tell, unless I'm regularly having sex... I'm gonna have panic attacks because of either my drive or lack of it being addressed properly, so my system always has the problem on the go

after a couple of years in the higher position, or maybe it was 2? or 1.2? I was having these events where

if I "looked" in a certain part in my brain, or memory, it would just overwhelm me with dread and I'd grab at my chest and I knew it would pass, and I just needed to get past that moment. It was like looking into hell itself, on top of everything else. 

I had been off work before with anxiety and had therapy with my psycologist intermitantly for a while, but I knew I couldn't continue I was always anxious, scared, couldn't ... hold my brain back anymore from terror, absolute, and I mean Absolute Dread ....and pain ... no one was helping... they sorta ... like some people have gotten better about it... but it's like picking yourself up from being dead and watching people just sit and watching you do it yourself... and it's hard because of that

the adhd find was a bit after going on leave,

but the ptsd has sorta been lifelong, as far as I can tell, I've never had a normal life in that way

I remember a friend of mine from back then, one of the only other people who had my back at times (and other times not, he was a kid too, after all, I don't hold ill will  - he's a really good dude and checks on me) told me "you were a hero for not coming in with a gun, it was that bad"

and him saying that was when I went "fuck, really?" and finally realized it wasn't...normal. 

I never dealt with anyof it because I didn't know how, couldn't orient in a world that didn't exist, and adhd segregated everything and allowed me to go "oh, a game" or "oh, this thing!"

parent's who would take me to a paster instead of MH professional during a fit of despair and depression, or who got stuck in their own beliefs, that if it doesn't fit that check mark in their head then it's autmatically wrong... 

I'm sure I'm forgetting a fuuuuuuuuuck tone of stuff, but thems the bullet points? 

I'll add more later... maybe

##

Well, here is more, I guess. I've spent the day just ... crying.  I prepared the above, went over it, after copying from where I wrote it the first time and it just snapped me. I'm out of weed, and that doesn't help either... provincial holiday for us, so all the stores are closed. I've spent my life, almost all of it, truely alone. I'm alone again now. I don't know if I can survive long like this. I wasn't trained like others were... I don't see self-value, I can't live for myself, resonante with myself. I don't have positive emotion tied to who I am. I don't understand it like others do. Yet, I feel almost everything in high definition, like others don't. 

Alot of my life I've had this image of hell... this black hole without form, that just continues inward. I've been terified to die, because of the things religion taught me. I've never really wanted to ... live tho, in a sense? I snapped away happy moments for myself, and that's when I'm ... well, the closet to the version of me I used to be able to pull out, but that one wasn't really all the way me either... and I fight through life because either I thought I was supposed to, I was trained too, or there wasn't really another option, not even death. 

I've killed off my belief in religion, obviously, it's toxic, and, frankly, evil. It's short cut thinking and it's nonsense if not qualified that way. 

Now it seems that because I've killed off my belief in religion, and I mean REALLLLLLY ended my belief in it, there isn't anything else ... holding me here? 

When you ask for help, when you are honest about it, when you find every possible way to explain these issues, and you see the response your friends and family, who've known you for years, give you... and they were the only things you even held on for... it says in moments, that all the years, all the pain I still can resonante with, because it's in my memory, ... it says that was worthless, my "battle" didn't mean anything...I was used to fit the expectation of everyoe else and no one... valued me for me, they just tried to make me what they wanted and just fucked me up... all the time I heald pain didn't mean anything. When you email your family and are frustrated by religion and say things you've never said before in relation to your own pain and the FIRST line of the response references the blow to the person themselves and how I view religion, instead of the pain...that email was months ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. You'll see your value in a second if you get an email like that. 

My entire life's pain is nothing more than a trauma response that I was stuck in from childhood and it was used by all of those around me. 

I often wonder if anyone has ever seen the real me. I've spent, literally, the majority of my life truely alone and I'm not ... I'm not capable of doing it anymore.  

There is a large difference in how much you care about someone, even on the basic human level, and what the behavior says. There is alot that has shown me... I wasn't ever loved, or CARED for...for WHO I WAS... and people treated me like a bull in a china shop, worrying about my effect on ... idk, the bullies, or life... I never really faught back. This writing exersize is still me trying to explain my pain, so when I say the shit I'm going to say... it's qualified. Maybe that's a bit of a problem, yeah? Maybe I should just say FUCK it, and speak...? maybe I should give up? Maybe I should just pick a spot, lay down, and wait until I'm nothing? 

It was good to get that out of my system. I can't hold back anymore - if I try it hurts... but it's always hurt.. I'm just able to notice it now and say "no more."


Maybe I'll finish the write up... maybe I won't... all part of the process in figuring that out, I guess. 

Either way this project is all I have left in life and I'm struggling to come up with an answer for ... wanting to continue after it's completed? I think that's fucking with me too. What is there after this? I lost everything that mattered, cause it never really mattered, but I was condiioned to think it did.

I guess, we'll find out soon enough. 

##

It seems that this project really is causing me to finally process... well, this and life, ending my marriage, but staying friends, dealing with what I actually think of my family and friend groups, etc. The unfortunate reality for me is ... I was completely and utterly abondoned... except it happened so long ago that the way things were seemed normal and I was left in the space, while traumatized and just looking to be safe? and could never be safe, because there was literally nothing to ... anchor myself with... but all the time being gaslit about their actual intentions, or lack there of, so they could feel better... The reality is no one really knows themselves, and the pain ... like when someone pushes back and hurts you as a result of you standing up for yourself... they've been triggered. I literally have a hard time ... seeing myself.. it's hard being that sort of ... baseline test for peoples intentions and seeing it all the time.

##

I think I feel more ... alive, or, maybe tuned in today. I got back from the 4.20 store and got what I needed. I've eaten, taken my stimulants.

I just looked up while writing this and realized I needed to take my anti depressant. I just took it. 

This project ... it's life threateningly dangerous for my mental state to process, without support, or without my needs met, without someone to really hold their arm under mine. That's not any different than it normally is, but I am akwnoledging that to myself now ... 

HOWEVER, there is a very strong chance the worst is behind me now.  The Strongest structures that needed demolishing and rebuilding have been addressed. 

I'm processing all 36 years at once. Writing things out. Making it public. This is what I've hidden all my life, being afraid. I've been terrified all my life and my life was ... a storm. That sucks. Well, it more than sucks, but I don't want to think too much in that area right now - > see above somewhere where I noted my hyper-sensitivty to thought images. 

I'm making myself vulnurable in all areas at once, in a way I haven't ever done before, and owning who I am now. 

There still isn't any value for myself, intrinsically. It seems the chemical background ... like, I'm so depressed that I can FEEL when just a little bit of dopamine hits, some feedback ... I flip back to normal so quick... but it shows me how much I was without it. 

When you can feel your coditioning, trying to re-write it, while thinking it through, taking ... account of an entire life of nothing but pain ... and doing that all at once ... it's ... destabalizing. 

But. But, I am doing this the right way. There is just so much damage to deal with and not enough of anything else. 

Off to write in the Myth System Section for a while. 

##

Myth System Section seems to have mostly come together. I have some Diagrams I may or may not add, or go back through with a few extra adds in places. I definitely need to clean up the grammar in places and spelling. 

I'm process-writing, in a sense, and once it's out of my system it seems that I worked though things or ... 

It's hard to describe this but... going through therapy ... my mind needs a place to "Put" things. To almost say they have been addressed. 

Often times, if I'm working through a beat, or drawing, coming up with a new technique, if I don't write it down... it hasn't been officially developed in my mind. Once it's written down, it's like a reference point for all the information that my brain has tagged along with it and it gets me into a certain "frame" much easier. 

An example of this... when I was really digging into the furthest depths I could personally find to rap structure and got it working so well in my head that it's sort of just like another language that I know now... it became easier to resonante with what I was listening too. 

I started to have anxiety of influence all the time... which by itself is sort of a dumb idea... we are literally influneced on the baseline level of human and that's what made us what we are... we should embrace and encourage further thinking into what made us that instead of ... pushing things away, in that sense. 

Anyways, when that happened, I created a playlist on spotify. If I got stuck in anxiety on a track for some stupid reason, heard someone do something completely different than what I do, but a certain phonetic element would land in the right place, in a rythme I understand and my brain ... didn't like it haha. Whenever that happened I added that track to that playlist and the issue vanished. It was "putting the thing in it's place" and having it addressed. 

I feel like that is what I'm doing here. I'm caustiously optimistic, let's say, about the future of things today. 

I feel I should say again, this is what processing looks like. In an Honest way. I think that honest part is really important to me. I've never really felt like I've been able to talk without... hurting others? Like the value of others, no matter the pain level I was in, always superseeded my own value and I would just... hold on or help, etc, etc. That's internaly sort of toxic, and this exersize is a type of exposure therapy. In the same sense... like, I used "Sketchbooks" as a name for my early rap work and trying to expose my feels of vulnerability with the asterisk that it wasn't meant to be anything other that sketches... that idea is also what's on display here. Letting my vulnurability be exposed so I can learn to stop tensing the place I'm expecting a punch from? something like that

Enough writing for me for now. I think I'm going to avoid doing alot of sketching until this is completed, since my mind can focus on sketching too long and bypass getting this or music completed. Some stuff always, it's healthy for me to draw, but the rate is going down for a bit.

I need to let out what I hold in, or held in, in a way that it has been dealt with ... in a way my ... seemily complex system recognizes.

As far as I can tell, I need to let my anger out in regards to being gaslit by my entire reality, and the trauma that it caused me over a lifetime by the echos of bouncing sound.  I need to be comfortable with self defining my own reality outside of the approval of others and  I need to say that the pain I had it... have... it shouldn't have been held inside for everyone else's comfort. I was never comfortable and no one taught or protected me in a way that ... was outside of their comfortable system of understand... they couldn't or didin't see the real me... they just saw the me they thought I was or they wanted me to be. The more I write and process, the more I move toward the music, track(s) with Xxxxxxxxx, and hopefully others...  the more my brain is finally being ready for people look at me ... regardless of what they think

The closer i get... the more I know it'll done and I'll have it owned it properly. I feel like, while writing this project, and while I was getting ready for it, I already have, for the most part, Owned it. I'm hitting threshold after threshold and im processing them now. I'll keep pushing. This has been one hell of a journey and it's almost complete. 

I'll be posting the definition, soon, and then roughly speaking, it'll be music and art focus from then on out. 

Enjoy
