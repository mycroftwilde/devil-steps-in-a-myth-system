### The Artist

##

Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told that it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really. 

##

#### About my writing and a quick preface: 

##

I think in Images, and Scenes, Feeling, in Emotion, and Texture, in Rythme... and, maybe even in Color... that one is recent, and I can't tell if I'm learning to read it or I'm projecting, it's probably a bit of both. I'm, generally speaking, incredible sensitive. I've been told before that I'm an empath. That was cool. 

If I'm tired and someone tells me something alarming, and then my brain "has" to think about it, it puts the scene in my mind and it can cause viseral reactions, like I'm there or feeling what the person could have felt from what I was told. 

I would imagine that may be attention related, along with my sensitivity ... try to concentrate on the road while driving in fog before? something like that. 

I'm articulate and smart, I've spent alot of time thinking and learning, and learning about how to be understood by others, or, to get my point accross, but ... and this is a BIG "but" ... BUT ... my attention is trash... BAD-BAD... unless something grabs it. And, for me, most of the time, the world is gray. It's boring. I do think that at one point it was probably brighter with... wonder(?) so many things to look into, or understand, the desire to touch my toes into the pools of possibility, but, that's all I had too, and for so many years now it's been more gray than I knew how to say.   

I felt like... starting here, this way, may be the best way to get a feel for how I describe things before you should read the story of some of the events that helped shape me... well, at least from the perseptive of this "current-self" of mine. 

I'm also writing this ...idk, "sudo-live," I guess, as an antiperfectionist exersize for myself. 

##

#### Topics:

##

General Topics will include my Backstory, My Mental Health Issues (Social and General Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, ADHD, Traits of OCD, and a lifetime of Depression that I didn't know existed, My once completely toxic reality lens born from a religiously cult-like toxic dogmatic style of worldview in upbringing/household, world vs us and all that ..., social abuse from my peers and bullies that would then see me isolated from any sort of ...normal socialization, I guess, and, unfortunatly, this was all included with my capability to adjust ... to ... hold on ... to ... "make do" ... until the very edge of what I could handle, and then more ...

When you fear death more than the depression of life, and living is actually painful, and grey, dull, and lifeless, it's more than you can properly understand or articulate, because it's all you ever saw or felt? idk, you learn to adjust. Steal the smallest moment of happy ... when you could get it, and then just ... be ... until you could get it again. The mind is a powerful thing.  I also learned that when you look into Hell ... Hell looks back ... it's one *ahem* Hell *ahem* of a rough experience ... *crickets*... okay... Okay, Okay... I tried right? *bow* ... right... moving on... I can feel that tension cut from here haha, let's all just calm a bit... it's just rough topic shit ... AND... just like the big "but", this is a big "AND" ... And, There is ... something beautiful about all this for me ... our hells are just that ... well, not "just" anything ... but, they are OUR Hells ... just like our reality is self-definited, in a sense,... well, in the same sense, our hell is the same ... And, luckily, it means that for each us, when we are in OUR Hells, we can know that WE are actually in control. Or, at least, we have more direct agency that we expct we do in those moments...years(?)

#### Trauma Background:

This was pulled from a conversation I had regarding my PTSD, and edited for the purpose of placing it here. I'm noting that, as the tone of the writing will change for this part. 

So ... may as well start at the beginning... *gets dusty book down from the top shelf and blows the dust off*
hahaha
So I grew up in a .. self idenfied "christian" household ... roughly thinking, you can use baptist or weaslian in your head, it's analogous enough.
The house I grew up in has/had this ... us vs them mentality in worldview. There is the "them" and there is the "saved." This was initially how Reality was divided up for me. 

The purpose of reality is being "saved." Everything else comes after that, it's the "mission" in life, in a sense. Not in a militant sense, well, I suppose depending on your definition, but in a more "loving" sense, but, it was unfortunatly toxically so... 

This is gonna build from alot of stuff that's probably gonna seem dissperse but seems relevant in the build of the image, since it all ties together
Growing up.. my dad met my mom when he was ... 34? I think, she was 19-20, they have a 15 year difference, was at a music event or something for the church. 

Mom was enamored and pursed the shy AF and also with social trauma, dad.

I think they had me, I'd say when dad was near 40, I wanna say? something like that

So, they have me and my brother, who is 2 years younger.

Alot of my ptsd comes back to social trauma, and the Fawning response built from other social ptsd I had in trauma.  Like one trauma on other. 


  - A Rough Definition for Fawning responses is this: 
"Fawning is a trauma response where a person develops people-pleasing behaviors to avoid conflict and to establish a sense of safety. In other words, the fawn trauma response is a type of coping mechanism that survivors of complex trauma adopt to "appease" their abusers."1

So, the stuff from childhood is like this -

We were put into a small private "Christian" "School" of about 30 people. (Quotes seperate on purpose...) up until about grade 3, that wasn't great from a socialization perspective, but, it became worse, with the overarching view of reality being given and without a grounding so far, but we swapped to public school in grade 4

About half way thru grade 4 I became like.. you see all those kids who are bullied in school from the movies...

I had it worse...

it was bad, bad... 

I often don't think about it but think about an entire social level, being kids my age, deciding I was .... lowest rung, almost always?

I was made of for ...being tall (? lmfao) for reacting to being emotionally hurt, for being physically hurt, for my last name (prins, being turned into princess to mock me with)

At recess I used to have to  follow the teachers, or keep them in eyeline (Remember, this happened for YEARS...)

Otherwise it would be potentially dangerous, I could get beat up or hurt

We lived close to the school, so we walked... Some of the bully kids did too, well, hell, alot of them did... 

It meant leaving my house or being ... out and about, thinking back now, felt dangerous, I think, always watching, having to be careful, always nervous... 

This was grade 4 - 8, the end of elementry school,  until I hit highschool in grade 9 ...  it was ... horrible

I also .. almost died in grade 4. 

They had this "hotdog" day. Teachers back then walked the hallways and checked on classrooms.

I choked... a bully of mine, a friend from before things shifted, saved my life by doing the hemlick ... which he learned from baywatch, of all things... that must have been complicated to feel. A bully literally saving my life, my parents view of what reality was, almost touching "death" so early and their nonsense and toxic beliefs... 

There was another time... peggys cove... I went too close to the edge, slipped. I can't remember how young. I Held onto the edge until my dad was able to get me

There was almost dying of croup when I was a kid due to being alergic to penecilin. 

I felt afraid of my dad dying, because he was older.. his dad - my grandfather,... died on my fathers 17th birthday in his 50s

That sort of potential lose, and a lose that was ... potentially close ... due to when they had me, and me being me ... I coddled my father... I held back, or was always sort of afraid of that I could cause him to have a heart attack? or the stress? ... anyways, the reason that was all important is with not ever feeling safe, always looking at death, "be right with god" and like me trying to drill down and no one giving me the answer that never satisfied anything ... with the social PTSD and not being safe ... I developed something like the fawning response (See above definition) 

Authority figures, bosses, like I could feel that change in dominance hierachy because it then affected me.. my worth or saftey or w/e, was all tied up in the environement

The places in control of me needed to be okay, or safe or happy, or w/e, there was subconcious weight in a room, me watching for that or making sure things were okay

And, again, me being me... like, I've been told all my life that I'm smart...  "teachers said you were a genius" whatever the f*** that means... it never sunk it... like how can you respect the opinion when it comes from teachers who don't know how to teach? or how to actually handle children properly? or to actually protect me? People could have told me that till they were blue in the face, but they didn't really have a leg to stand on from the perspective of assessment, and it was obvious.  So, to me, it always felt like it was a short cut answer for the things they couldn't handle or didn't want to put the work into. 

but shit isn't ... hard for me either... not really, like I haven't been able to put my mind to something I couldn't figure out eventually... or at least try? BUT, to get me engaged was sooooooooo hard. I would say almost impossible. Things were too easy. 

when I was in the dentist chair recently, just as a side thought... it was getting dark outside. Lights from above, but it's glass all around the chair

and it's dark and I, when I wasn't medicated with stimulants, I'd feel that sort of change and it would give me a sort of sadness, it happened alot when I was younger, but I was soooo sensitive to shit because I never was ... alive, I guess and always just hiding from pain, or my thoughts, or worries

anyways, to continue along this hanging lantern trail hahah

I guess, I should mention the other worries I had when I was younger, I remember for months at a time having these

fears

it was worse at night, the days were better

but it would be like

I'd find a lump on my chest

and I'd think it was cancer

couldn't talk about it, didn't want to think about death or know what to do, and at night it was like just this huuuuge feeling of dread and fear and just trying to get away from it and be happy for a little while

that happend alot, it was probably tied to the fears of death and me being told all that other shit and my view of reality being fucked 

anyways, so we get to highschool and things get a little better

the shift in social groups, add in some groups, take away from other groups

It helped me dissappear from being the main focus of being punchable or fuckwithable lol

the later years were better

and I took another year in highschool cause ... to get me engaged or to care was rooooooooooooough, neeeded to recomplete a few courses cause stuff just wasn't done lol

but I remember that last year being better

the kids my age

the ones that the fears were with maybe but that year felt a little better

now near the end of highschool I start having panic attacks

I was dating a girl at the time, Let's call her GF1, and all the religious shit, expectiations I'd imagine, unhealthy views of soooo much shit... and the relationship wasn't working.. I stopped caring as much, couldn't see it as much.. remember losing my erection during sex once and me being like "WTF is happening!" and then that becoming an anxiety... or wait, no I was working at the accounting firm, after I finished college. GF1 and I started dating at the end of highschool

This fawning shit is still going on without me know and my sytem and what my reality was telling me, etc, and I'm probably just a leaf in the wind of depression and anxiety, and I don't ... like I didn't really care about anything as a focus, because that develops when your sort of baselined.. I never was. Anyway... 

GF1 and I break up, life continues and we can probably skip a few years and another relationship until I'm living in north bay, working IT for a company and living by myself.. been having anxiety and depression issues. Back into religion to understand the world again and I'm losing my f***ing mind just trying to ... understand reality.. in a sense of "how can I be okay, what is saved, what do I need to do"

I'm masturbating at this time too, no sex,

There is a reason I'm bringing that up, besides just being blanket honest.  There is a pattern I noticed recently with that and when I have my panic attacks, or the panic attacks that aren't specifically tied to a source of stress

it seems when I'm not having sex, or engaged in that system, and because my parents... like so... my parents never dealt with sex. It was sort of a ... conversation I don't ever remember having besides "don't have it before marriage."

 They were so focused on that. Mom used to "tsk" when nudity came on the screen if we watched a movie.... lmfao - think about an animal having a reaction everytime they feel a feeling and external stimulie comes in... anyways .. like it was to the point when I was dating GF1 they didn't have ... doors on our bedrooms

it was fucked from that degree, but that was "normal" ... not that it stopped me...

 So, the sexual side of human nature... that system wasn't... normalized ... an undercurrent of anxiety followed me I had to pull apart from every other angle because... reality was "x, not y" *eye roll* (a -sexual wife after, to hang a lantern on that)

so the company I was working for at that time, after I gave up on religion again had an office out in Moncton
