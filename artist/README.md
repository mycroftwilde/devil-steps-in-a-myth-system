### The Artist

##

Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told that it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really.

#### About my writing and a quick preface: 

##

I think in Images, and Scenes, Feeling, in Emotion, and Texture, in Rythme... and, maybe even in Color... that one is recent, and I can't tell if I'm learning to read it or I'm projecting, it's probably a bit of both. I'm, generally speaking, incredible sensitive. I've been told before that I'm an empath. That was cool. 

If I'm tired and someone tells me something alarming, and then my brain "has" to think about it, it puts the scene in my mind and it can cause viseral reactions, like I'm there or feeling what the person could have felt from what I was told. 

I would imagine that may be attention related, along with my sensitivity ... try to concentrate on the road while driving in fog before? something like that. 

I'm articulate and smart, I've spent alot of time thinking and learning, and learning about how to be understood by others, or, to get my point accross, but ... and this is a BIG "but" ... BUT ... my attention is trash... BAD-BAD... unless something grabs it. And, for me, most of the time, the world is gray. It's boring. I do think that at one point it was probably brighter with... wonder(?) so many things to look into, or understand, the desire to touch my toes into the pools of possibility, but, that's all I had too, and for so many years now it's been more gray than I knew how to say.   

I felt like... starting here, this way, may be the best way to get a feel for how I describe things before you should read the story of some of the events that helped shape me... well, at least from the perseptive of this "current-self" of mine. 

I'm also writing this ...idk, "sudo-live," I guess, as an antiperfectionist exersize for myself.

#### Topics:

##

General Topics will include my Backstory, My Mental Health Issues (Social and General Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, ADHD, Traits of OCD, and a lifetime of Depression that I didn't know existed, My once completely toxic reality lens born from a religiously cult-like toxic dogmatic style of worldview in upbringing/household, world vs us and all that ..., social abuse from my peers and bullies that would then see me isolated from any sort of ...normal socialization, I guess, and, unfortunatly, this was all included with my capability to adjust ... to ... hold on ... to ... "make do" ... until the very edge of what I could handle, and then more ...

When you fear death more than the depression of life, and living is actually painful, and grey, dull, and lifeless, it's more than you can properly understand or articulate, because it's all you ever saw or felt? idk, you learn to adjust. Steal the smallest moment of happy ... when you could get it, and then just ... be ... until you could get it again. The mind is a powerful thing.  I also learned that when you look into Hell ... Hell looks back ... it's one *ahem* Hell *ahem* of a rough experience ... *crickets*... okay... Okay, Okay... I tried right? *bow* ... right... moving on... I can feel that tension cut from here haha, let's all just calm a bit... it's just rough topic shit ... AND... just like the big "but", this is a big "AND" ... And, There is ... something beautiful about all this for me ... our hells are just that ... well, not "just" anything ... but, they are OUR Hells ... just like our reality is self-definited, in a sense,... well, in the same sense, our hell is the same ... And, luckily, it means that for each us, when we are in OUR Hells, we can know that WE are actually in control. Or, at least, we have more direct agency that we expct we do in those moments...years(?)
