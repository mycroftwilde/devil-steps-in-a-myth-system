Here we are going to go over my Lens. This will entail a little bit of a longer story than what you might expect. 

I've been told it's a hard story to read... I'm not sure that I really feel anything at all about it, myself. It simply is? Something like that. Green is also a color. It's something like that. 

So, if you were to ask is this hard to write or talk about? No. No, Not at all. Easy as Breathing, really. 

General Topics will include my Backstory, Mental Health Issues (Social and General Anxiety Disorders, PTSD, ADHD, Traits of OCD, and a lifetime of Depression that I didn't know existed, a once completely toxic reality lens born from an also toxic religiously cult-like dogmatic style of upbringing, world vs us and all..., social abuse from my peers and bullies that would see me isolated from any sort of ...normal socialization, I guess, and, unfortunatly, this was all included with my capability to adjust... to hold on... to "make do" ... until the very edge of what I could handle, and then more... When you fear death more than the depression of life, and your pain in living is more than you can properly understand or articulate, idk, you learn to adjust? The mind is a powerful thing.
