### Information Structure

##

I'm not sure how to preface this one quickly, besides saying "I'm a Weird Dude, but..." or something like that, haha... 

So, I'm a Weird Dude, but ... haha

... have you ever tried to create your own organizational system that encompases all information? 

No? 

... See, Told you, I'm Weird Dude... haha

Let's imagine it like this: 

You're in a library and you've got all these books that relate to information... and something just isn't quite right with the way it's organized. 

Picture all the catagorizes you've ever been told. 

Here are a few to get you started, if it helps:

- Fiction
- Non-Fiction
- Fiction Genre and Sub-Genre
- Non-Fiction General Subject
- Author
- Size of Book
- Color of Books Cover
- Year of Publication
- Publisher
- Age Rating

Try to see how that structure for information is setup.

Now, if YOU had to organize all the information in a library, how would you do it and which pillars would create the backbone for where to put everything?
