# Myth Systems

##

Myth Systems, that lens of interpretation has always been so interesting to me, even before it was named in my head. 

This comes to my artistic drives again, but something I loved to do was image different worlds, how things fit together, be a world builder, in a sense, from a writing perspective. 

When I was younger, trying to think of all the possible things that could be combined, or that would be needed to understand ...a build world from start to end times.. I would make lists for myself. Lists of different Myth Creatures, Names for unique or interesting parts of different animals that could be cross applied to some sort of magic system, religions or different ideas around Religion, etc. I had binders full. That sort of exploration excited me. I think that came from Manga and Anime and the Dominance Hiarachy Climb style of narrative structure in Shonen Manga, as well as pictures and images, while I was listening to music, and the overlays that I experienced while reading and imaging. 

Anyways, because of that skillset, when I approached... or, that is to say, doing the above, and some other things, I created a sort of engine that would run in my head and would listen for things that would excite it, when I was mentally in the right place, to create ideas and worlds. 

So, when I approached a few things that I wanted to learn about at the time - The Double Slit Experiment/MultiWorlds Theory, The Start of the Universe, Sethian/Agnostic Gospels, etc... I suppose all of those were exposure therapy exersize, if I'm being honest, but I few things clicked for me... I could sort of abstractly world build ideas of this and, for my internal system, overlay them properly. Like, If we approached religious texts like Magic systems that had dependancies and had to work, what would it look like? - That's sort of the Idea as a whole. 

Here are a few: 

So, there was this question posed: How Can God be All Powerful, All Loving, and All Merciful, or something like that, and still allow hell to occur, etc. The Thought was an interesting one, but there is an easy solve for that: 

Let's supposed God itself is at the start of "time" or "change" and it's just everything. It's possibility incarnate. Always shifting and never anything specific. Now, if it goes out into this absolute void and tries to create... perhaps it ties itself into the running system. It may get feedback. Let's assume "sin" is an infection, and let's super impose the image of a sinking ship, to a degree, if the ship waits too long it sinks and everyone loses... all while the captain got his hand on the watch like "look, all I can do is what I can do, here is everyone you need to know, etc."
