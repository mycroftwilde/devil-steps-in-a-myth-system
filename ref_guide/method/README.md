### The Image

Using Rap, Music, and Overlaying Images, combined (See the reels on my instagram for the idea) ... the scene will be of Dueling for your own reality, with the most powerful tools at our disposal - Information, communication, language, sound, and emotional resonances, and accompanying art to pull us deeper into the experience. 

The format is being planned as a limited-comic-like Series with a monthly release schedule. Art will also reflect that overlay. I'd like to see if I can take overlaying influnences, like Ol'Uncle Alan did, and do it my way ... while referencing what he did with League of Ex-G
