### The REALLY Quick Image and Cover Mock-up

Using Language, Music, and Overlaying Images - combined (See the reels on my instagram for the idea) ... the scene will be of Dueling for your own reality, with the most powerful tools at our disposal - Information, communication, language, sound, and emotional resonances, with accompanying art to pull us deeper into the experience. 

The format is being planned as a Limited-Comic-Like-Series with a Monthly release schedule. Art will also reflect that overlay. I'd like to see if I can take overlaying influnences, like Ol'Uncle Alan did, and do it my way ... while referencing what he did with League of Ex-G
