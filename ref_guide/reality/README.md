### Myth Systems, our Lens, and Individual Reality Experience
##

This section is a fun one for me. 

Perception, or our understanding of our own perception is important to understand. 

I view reality like this: 

We exist in a sigular reality of experience on an individual level, and so does every other individual. None of us technically speaking, see or experience the same thing, even if we were all in the same place, looking at the same thing. 

I grew up in a religious household and that shit is ... bad, if not qualified correctly. Imagine a kid who NEEDED absolute saftey, in a sense, or was so fucking critical of himself, that when he turned that critical lens outward... which he almost never did... things never ever held up to scrutiny. My life was trying to steer a boat in a hurricane.

The reason I bring up religion is important. The thing about religion, of any kind, is it's an overlay. A way to interpret the data we see. This system of ... taking in too much information and giving it meaning ... it's a part of human nature, it's cross applicable to the religious and non religious. I think if I was to look at one of my thinking mentors... in a sense. Ah, I should explain. 

See I wanted to be alot of different creative things growing up - Artist, Comic Writer, Novelest and World Builder of these absolute systems of world chronology, musician, digital animator, video game designer.. the list goes on. 

Anyways, along the course of that Journey I picked up a book by comic book Author Alan Moore, in regards to writing comics. When I read it... I was confused, in a sense. Other books I had read on the same topic were more ... technical, or granular. More... defined in what they were giving you as a baseline. Alan wrote his book trying to teach people how to THINK about writing, and story, etc, the other books taught you to do. 

The thing about the difference between these two is ... like that's a countries size in difference between what both of those things even ... did to an individual. 

In a sense, really, it seems that would be the difference between understanding things as being "Truth" and a "Myth System Representation." 

One teachs ritual and the other teaches a persons individual ritual, how to self define it or quantify it on an individual level, and then when why both the ritual itself and the individual interpretation of the ritual is important. 

Anyways, back to Uncle Alan, when I finally understand what his book was trying to do I became enamored, to a degree, with the style of thinking he had. Watching some documentaries, considered his positions on things, etc. Going through his documentaries, to give an example of myth systems, I think he would or maybe did, intepret reality, at least to some degree, via magic. 

I'm not even sure I would go so far as to see he would see what he did with magic as another other than how we see religion, but that's just a read on my part with my definitions for the same subject, which may cause some ... differences of opinion if not proprerly qualified. 

A way we can see ourselves, and our lens, as well, is something like -> The Universe Begins -> We get to the point of Humans -> We get to the point of You being Born. The Three Main Tentpoints of the timeline to you or me, maybe? Anyways, It's at this point we can qualify some things: 

You're born with that specific set of Genetics, down this human line, all the way from the beginning. You are unique. 

We can probably say there are variables in both term carrying and the birth itself, both going well or having complications causing an issue with the initial growth. 

Then it's conditioning, enviromental effects, on that base, while it grows, learns, puts emotion or meaning behind what it sees as it grows, as a completely unique being that has never existed before. It's like... we get hit with possibility matrix after possibility matrix, a cacophony of them. 

We must also consider the fact that in "space" and "time" as it were, the world itself is also unique. What's in the Air, the Water, Weather, the Seasons, Animal Life, Plant Life, How much Light is getting to Earth... there is so many things affecting what we think of the earth as a whole... so, it's not just us that is unique. A

Now, too, the other individual realities interacting with ours, during this specific period of "time," they also grew, were affecting by env variables, etc, they are also unique. 

There is no ... baseline truth, or that is to say... we agree, the individual realities, on what we see, together, in a sense. How our mind was literally put together is unique, what we resonant with.. that is Human but is also uniquely us -> Think music. There is a reason music creates what it does in us. There is a reason music as a whole can affect anyone, a sort of meta rule of human. Then there is the unique parts of what we individually hear and are drawn too. What emotion is behind what element, because it was conditioned in at specifc time of growth or emotion in our lives, and maybe the music key characteristics helped it nest better.

That may also help you understand this part of the idea a bit more. If we understand that Music Keys have emotional Characteristics, we can see that music affects humans, in a sense, however, I'm not sure at what cultural affect, in am emotionally certain way accross the board, right?

Then it's the individual "tastes" that would be assigned after that. 

Now, here is another few ways we can look at the way that we agree on reality together ... let's start with language

We assign values of meaning to words so that we can recall what something is, representionally, quickly, communicate it more easily,and maybe so we can abstract or think around things in our internal worlds more efficiantly.

Now, let's try to think of the meaning behind one of these assigned values

We will use a single world to not even add extra movement or ways to think about meaning. Just a single word and you think of the represention behind it. 

Let's try this... here we go: 

"Book."

This is the interesting part to me... not a single person, just on the frame of a single common Noun like that, would resonante the same way. If you thought of a book itself, or pulled up the image of a specific book...  the color of cover, the smell of pages, the size of the book, if it had creases, had a specific emotional value or extra meaning to you personally, if it was a general looking book, with the same general questions as the specific book... if the word itself was thought of, and not really an image, but just knowing what it was and it resonanting in a personally representive way that may be hard to articulate to another indivudual. Someone may have pulled up something like a dictionary definition, and if that's the case, was it by itself or in the dictionary surrounded by other words too? was that also shown in a book?

I can probably go on for a long time, but, let's keep moving... 

So, in a sense, a Myth System is how we representionally understand the World. The Values that we have, individually, behind meaning. This applies to Religion, Non-Religion, This Applies to Governements, and the Concept of ... well, anything, really. This even applies to concepts and the concept of "concepts." 

It's Our Internal Catagorization and Reality interpretationn Lens System of Our External Reality Experience, that is absolutely and utterly unique. It was built from our day one, hit with all the possibilities in a world that is also absolutely and utterly unique.. It changes moment to moment too, after all. 



The Value that is mostly accurate, but actually not accurate at all, and at the same time... mostly accurate? You may just want to ignore that last sentance of me ... idk, pontificating.

Here is another way you can look at your reality interpretation system. 

Think about going into a new room. Say I invite you over to my place, like "Hey!! Come over, let's hang out and watch the world go by with a couple of drinks and a thing to smoke!"

You get to my place, I meet you out back, behind the apartment building. We talk for a moment and then I bring you back inside. 

When I open the door to my aprtment and go inside there is a huge difference in what we exerpeince, even from an attention and focus level. 

You're walking into an all new room you haven't seen before. You're taking in information. You're "seeing" more than I am. 

I'm walking back into a room I just walked out of and seeing things I know where they all are ... in a sense, it's been catagorized in my mind, and my mind is able to bypass them, from a "completely awake attention" perspective... but... let's say, while I was outside my cat took a shit on the floor... he's an ass, I tell you... well, that new item, that wasn't there before, in a sense wasn't catagorized before, is going to stick out to me because it's different or stark against the expectations and normal bypassing of what we see when we look at things we've catagozied, let's say. 

That difference, I mean we can put it in a graph and go up and down in severity or something, but we all experience some difference in reality moment to moment like that. I think one of the most important things for any individual, is somehow grasping this idea for themselves. With it, we can more easily... idk, either understand what's occuring more clearly, or feel ... less personally affected in our reality experience, at any level of definition? something like that.

Anyways, to wrap things up as a whole, "It's Our Internal Catagorization and Reality interpretationn Lens System of Our External Reality Experience." I think this is a decent overall definition for what a Myth System is. 

It's not TRUTH tho... Religion, let's go back there for a moment. I feel like the image in my head is something like "Religion is a way humans have created different species level myth and lens systems to interpret reality with, but they themselves are like school... they get somethings baseline right for human nature... that we need a system of intepretation or community, resonante love and caring, feeling supported, human pace, a place of ... last resort, perhaps, of reality saftey net, to let us take risks easier...a place where the myth system reality between individuals is ... more connected than in other places... where we are always fighting against a system that doesn't really play well with how we intepret, due to the individuality basis vs community basis...but without the correct other definitions... without clarity in individuality reality and experience and purpose ... it's all a wash. It's just a govenment that tells you it loves you and to understand the world X way because it's easier. 

The thing about it being a wash... Let's think through some things here too... let's apply some overlays, perhaps. 

This always rings in my head, but it is sort of a Meta Reality Truth too. 

"give to caesar what is caesar's"

The thing about religion... even if it's mostly truth, in a intepretatively workable way, it's still OUR attempt to touch on the "God" system of reality. I would say, in the same breathe, almost, that Religion is the worlds way of trying to ecapselate reality, but the second it touches "Human" and becomes a system ... it's broken, we are all individually reality ecapselated and it should better be understood as a ATTEMPT by us... Tag it as belonging to the "World" in a sense, and not whatever diety we worship as the bringing of life and salvation, etc, religion is the school system by which too many broken hands have been in a pot trying to correct and over correct, without taking the individual into account and prioritizing that so that the individual ... actually has agency. The way things appear... 

It's the Story of the Garden of Eden. 

I've had a problem with it a long time. Part of that stems from ... my adhd and not understanding a sort of "not ever changing" life ... but, the problem looks like this: 

Do Adam and Eve get the Choice of: Life and Ignorance, which in essense, looks like Non-Life, because there is no actual ability to make a fully knowledgeable concious choices, or Knowledge and Death, which to me looks like the start of... growth? We are changing all the time... we change moment to moment, second to second. We see. We internalize. We understand. We Grow. We get Hurt. We Change. etc, x infinity... and that is intrinsically tied to LIFE... being ALIVE. Growing, exploring, seeing, experiencing ... without change and choice... we born automitons without knowing it. We without change ... we are dead. Like, our cells, even... "Time" could be better read as "Change" or understood that way. The intrinsic nature of reality itself is CHANGE, and without that... I mean, this just ... like biblical alagory story aside, change and growth appear to be the key defining factors of life itself.

I mean, another idea, I think this is what Trauma is so ... rough ... if change stops... we get stuck ... we change at a different rate, expereience reality differently now ... a stuck reality is a reality that isn't constantly growing and learning and ... engaging with the systems that make human... human. 

There are other baseline things that would affect experience as well, like

- Dehydration 
- Sleep Deprivation 
- Depression 
- Hyper-Vigilance 
- Mania 
- Psycosis 
- Schizophrenia
- Starvation
- Allergies
- ADHD (ADD/ADHD are all under ADHD now)
- Positive/Negative Emotional Balance and Overall State
- Exersize and regular movement 
- DID
- Pi-Polar Disorder 
- Sexual Repression or Base Biological needs not being met 
- General Emotional Stability 
- Blood Sugar Levels 
- Caffine Intake 
- Mediciation Intake 
- Senses Loss of Definition 
- Evnironemental Light, C02, Humditiy Levels, Heat
- Alcohol 
- Hard Drugs
- Nicotine
- Cannibus
- Musical Emotional Priming 
- Personal Resonances 

It's really infinite, so I'm going to stop there. 

So, again, our Myth System 

"It's Our Internal Catagorization and Reality interpretationn Lens System of Our External Reality Experience." There is probably more I need to add to that definition, but for the time being it will do.
