### Reality
##

This section is a fun one for me. 

Perception, or our understanding of our own perception is important to understand. 

I view reality like this: 

We exist in a sigular reality of experience on an individual level, and so does every other individual. None of us technically speaking, see or experience the same thing, even if we were all in the same place, looking at the same thing. 

I grew up in a religious household and that shit is ... bad, if not qualified correctly. Imagine a kid who NEEDED absolute saftey, in a sense, or was so fucking critical of himself, that when he turned that critical lens outward... which he almost never did... things never ever held up to scrutiny. My life was trying to steer a boat in a hurricane.

The reason I bring up religion is important. The thing about religion, of any kind, is it's an overlay. A way to interpret the data we see. This system of ... taking in too much information and giving it meaning ... it's a part of human nature, it's cross applicable to the religious and non religious. I think if I was to look at one of my thinking mentors... in a sense. Ah, I should explain. 

See I wanted to be alot of different creative things growing up - Artist, Comic Writer, Novelest and World Builder of these absolute systems of world chronology, musician, digital animator, video game designer.. the list goes on. 

Anyways, along the course of that Journey I picked up a book by comic book Author Alan Moore, in regards to writing comics. When I read it... I was confused, in a sense. Other books I had read on the same topic were more ... technical, or granular. More... defined in what they were giving you as a baseline. Alan wrote his book trying to teach people how to THINK about writing, and story, etc, the other books taught you to do. 

The thing about the difference between these two is ... like that's a countries size in difference between what both of those things even ... did to an individual. 

In a sense, really, it seems that would be the difference between understanding things as being "Truth" and a "Myth System Representation." 

One teachs ritual and the other teaches a persons individual ritual, how to self define it or quantify it on an individual level, and then when why both the ritual itself and the individual interpretation of the ritual is important. 

Anyways, back to Uncle Alan, when I finally understand what his book was trying to do I became enamored, to a degree, with the style of thinking he had. Watching some documentaries, considered his positions on things, etc. Going through his documentaries, to give an example of myth systems, I think he would or maybe did, intepret reality, at least to some degree, via magic. 

I'm not even sure I would go so far as to see he would see what he did with magic as another other than how we see religion, but that's just a read on my part with my definitions for the same subject, which may cause some ... differences of opinion if not proprerly qualified. 

A way we can see ourselves, and our lens, as well, is something like -> The Universe Begins -> We get to the point of Humans -> We get to the point of You being Born. The Three Main Tentpoints of the timeline to you or me, maybe? Anyways, It's at this point we can qualify some things: 

You're born with that specific set of Genetics, down this human line, all the way from the beginning. You are unique. 

We can probably say there are variables in both term carrying and the birth itself, both going well or having complications causing an issue with the initial growth. 

Then it's conditioning, enviromental effects, on that base, while it grows, learns, puts emotion or meaning behind what it sees as it grows, as a completely unique being that has never existed before. It's like... we get hit with possibility matrix after possibility matrix, a cacophony of them.
