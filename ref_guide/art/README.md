### Art



##

#### Preface

I’ve had HUGE, HUGE attention problems all my life, mixed with PTSD and social trauma…. For me… Art… the resonance from it… it was one of the only things that woke me up. Made me feel alive. It was my life… without knowing it consciously, however. 


Visual Art and all the Art within the structures of story, and music…and the drive to see more and hear more… all rhythms of what made human… human … It was something that seemed out of my reach a lot of the time, and retreating to it was a way to touch on what… or who… I am, 


I’m also… I try to know what I’m looking at, I guess…and I spent alot of time, without realizing it, trying to define almost everything…  in a way I could understand it. This is rooted in the aforementioned PTSD, social trauma, a fauning response born out of necessity to psychologically survive, and an inability to see outside the hurricane of pain due to my ADHD, which allowed me to segregate trauma and have small moments of “okay” or be “happy for a time” 

Almost all of those times were with Art, or things that set off the response of that beauty that catches my attention so …absolutely.  

This, over a period of time, for an entire life… but, How do you define what takes your attention like that, though… in the mix of a storm and nothing else? 

How do we define wonder and growth, and that sort of experience?

#### General Definition

I think it’s really about displaying ourselves, or, our reality, and I feel it … Well, that it can't be anything else.
  
Within the display of ourselves, there is the WHAT we are displaying and HOW we are displaying it. 

So, for the WHAT, I think it’s a combination of … the structural human species elements, the age or the environments, and then our unique lens. 

And, then, for the HOW, it’s about taking the previously mentioned what and making something that resonates with us and, hopefully, any potential audience.

Maybe it could be said like - "an emotional philosophy-styled approach to the examination of the structural human, "culture" (or world, if you will), and self."

#### Thoughts

Now, if we cross-apply how I have information structure setup: 

Universe -> Human -> World 

or 

Universe <-> Human <-> World

Ths allows us to see WHAT we are trying to express within that set of resonant responses, the ones we are trying to create with things that generally affect human (color and emotion, musical key characteristics, perspective, perfect structure, previously nested resonances for specific groups we are trying to cause a response with, etc) overlapped with our expression.   



Messages from individual realities to other individual realities, to the quorum, perhaps, with all the tools we have to communicate to other humans ...  



Messages in a bottle ... one reality to another, all in a waveform ocean of competing intention-weighted probability fields climbing over each other, all affecting each other, but, we, the artists ... sill hope to... change what we see, or, maybe ... to be heard, as unlikely as it is...?
