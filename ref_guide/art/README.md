### Art

#### Preface

I’ve had HUGE, HUGE attention problems all my life, mixed with PTSD and social trauma…. For me… Art… the resonance from it… it was one of the only things that woke me up. Made me feel alive. It was my life… without knowing it consciously, however. 


Visual Art and all the Art within the structures of story, and music…and the drive to see more and hear more… all rhythms of what made human… human … It was something that seemed out of my reach a lot of the time, and retreating to it was a way to touch on what… or who… I am, 


I’m also… I try to know what I’m looking at, I guess…and I spent alot of time, without realizing it, trying to define almost everything…  in a way I could understand it. This is rooted in the aforementioned PTSD, social trauma, a fauning response born out of necessity to psychologically survive, and an inability to see outside the hurricane of pain due to my ADHD, which allowed me to segregate trauma and have small moments of “okay” or be “happy for a time” 

Almost all of those times were with Art, or things that set off the response of that beauty that catches my attention so …absolutely.  

This, over a period of time, for an entire life… but, How do you define what takes your attention like that, though… in the mix of a storm and nothing else? 

How do we define wonder and growth, and that sort of experience?
