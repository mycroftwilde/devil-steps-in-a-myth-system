### Story

##

Story is important for what it tells us about "human." 

Here is an idea: 

1. Take all the stories in the world

2. Figure out a way to represent all the different types of structure, what we are talking about, essentially, and anything else we can quantify. 


    (there would be a ton, I'm just lazy right now... lol) 


3. Put all those figures in a table.... think excel. Each columb represents a different book, and each row are all the different quantified variables. 

4. Have something like a computer do a factor analysis (I think that's what it's called, anyway...) on those rows and columbs, checking them against each other, to see:

  -  what's similiar about everything
  -  what isn't
  -  what are the most common elements
  -  What's the least
  -  If we had represent the majority within a structure, what are the main points and what direction do they go in
  
    (again, lots more... you guys heard me say I'm lazy today, right? - that joke rythme is definitely a family guy resonance pull lol) 

The above, is a quick way to look at meta story. 

The Hero's Journey has done this, roughly speaking, with Myths, Mythology, Legends, Origin Stories, etc... 

The general idea is this: if we boil everything down, WHAT are we expressing, all of us, even wthout knowing it? What's the underlaying structure of the human story? 

The interesting thing about this, really, is that since we are all in individual realities, using expression to communicate, or, to touch on other realities ... what would this say about what reality itself is, when we boil down these ... outward expresssions to other realities, the REAL parts of ourselves?

#### Thoughts

What I find interesting about this, or maybe the way my brain took it, was that if we boil things down (and the same sort of idea can be seen in Harmon's version) it comes to Four Main Quadrants, made up of 2 sections overlapping.

On the top half we have the Known - or the Known World

On the bottom half we have the Unknown - or the Unknown World 

![2](/art/SSh2.PNG?raw=true "2")

On the Right Side, we have the Old Us 

On the Left Side, we have the New Us

![3](/art/SSh3.JPG?raw=true "3")

We start on this Step, Step 1

![4](/art/SSh4.PNG?raw=true "4")

We move to this Step, Step 2 

![5](/art/SSh5.PNG?raw=true "5")

Then on to this Step, Step 3

![6](/art/SSh6.PNG?raw=true "6")

And, Finally, on to Step 4

![7](/art/SSh7.PNG?raw=true "7")

The Four Steps in totality, look like: 

1. Old Us - In the Known World 

2. Old Us - in the Unknown World 

3. New Us - in the Unknown World 

4. New Us - In the Known World 

. 

I used to call this "The Equation for Human Catalysm" ... Not that catalysm is a word.. lol 

But, to the point, on the basic layer, in what it is to be Human, and change... which to another point, is happening all the time... this is the pattern we should recognize.  This is how we change. How we evolve, step by step...  We have thousands of these little equations running all the time, all at the same time, in our realities... and, for me, personally ... once I tied how humans change to that image and the Four Quadrants... it became easier to make ... choices, I guess? about going "Well, maybe I shouldn't be doing this other change cycle at the same time... I'm still processing, X, Y, and Z, have plans at 4..." etc.. 

Another interesting thing about this... Individual Words... they are personal reality representative, even if we do our best to curb communicationn issues with .... idk, quorom agreement?... anyways, they are EXTREMELY important with the orientation of what something actually "is." 

Here is an idea I came up with... 2 days ago? something like that, just playing around with what I knew and how I viewed change, psychology, and how I MAY represent this now to myself in a different way
