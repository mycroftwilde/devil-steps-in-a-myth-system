### Story

##

Story is important for what it tells us about "human." 

Here is an idea: 

1. Take all the stories in the world

2. Figure out a way to represent all the different types of structure, what we are talking about, essentially, and anything else we can quantify. (there would be a ton, I'm just lazy right now... lol) 

3. Put all those figures in a table.... think excel. Each columb represents a different book, and each row are all the different quantified variables. 

4. Have something like a computer do a factor analysis (I think that's what it's called, anyway...) on those rows and columbs, checking them against each other, to see:

  -  what's similiar about everything
  -  what isn't
  -  what are the most common elements
  -  What's the least
  -  If we had represent the majority within a structure, what are the main points and what direction do they go in
  
    (again, lots more... you guys heard me say I'm lazy today, right? - that joke rythme is definitely a family guy resonance pull lol) 

The above, is a quick way to look at meta story. 

The Heroes journey had done this, roughly speaking, with Myths, Mythology, Legends, Origin Stories, etc... 

The general idea is this: if we boil everything down, WHAT are we expressing, all of us, even wthout knowing it? What's underlaying structure?
