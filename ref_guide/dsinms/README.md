#### Devil Steps in a Myth System - General Concept:

## 

The idea behind this statement is, roughly, we must take agency from the reality we are given before we can be truly considered "alive."

It is also overlayed with the idea that a Myth System, the lens system with which we interpretate our experiences ... it isn't "Real" ... not in the way we think of the word "Real," anyway ... it's a built systems interprative experience ... it's a part of the human experience to create that system, but, unfortunately, that system will always house ... problems ... our "Devils," if we will.

This project is intended to represent this idea - that we must first approach the things we fear, perhaps even walk the same steps of the devil himself ... before we can finally learn to make real choices and see the world, and what OUR reality actually is.
