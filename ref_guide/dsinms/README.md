#### Devil Steps in a Myth System - General Concept:

## 

The idea behind this statement is, roughly, we must take agency from the reality we are given before we can be truly considered "alive."

It is also overlayed with the idea that a Myth System, the lens system with which we interpretate our experiences ... it isn't "Real" ... not in the way we think of the word "Real," anyway ... it's a built systems interprative experience ... it's a part of the human experience to create that system, but, unfortunately, that system will always house ... problems ... our "Devils," if we will.

This project is intended to represent this idea - that we must first approach the things we fear, perhaps even walk the same steps of the devil himself ... before we can finally learn to make real choices and see the world, and what OUR reality actually is.

Let's Define things with a few images at first, maybe. Or, perhaps, statements. 

This is about... truely displying the internally battled emotional hurricane, and what things could feel like for someone like me, or others, who viserally experience reality due to mental illness, trauma, and a Neuro-Non-typical Mind, that others ask us to hold for their comfort. 

It's about displaying the potential that was ... bottled up for the ... prioritization, perhaps, of everyone else. Processing is a bitch like that, right, like if things build up... we know things, we understand them, but the emotional... rainbow of this, or the viseral reality of it, still needs to be expressed. 

This is about... letting things out and showing others what it may feel like, and what we may even emotionally and viserally feel... for someone like us to just to have to live ... and then be told constantly that they are too much for others, who don't try ... this, all while living in an individual reality that is already overwhelming.

This is about ... a dedication to the younger self. The ones who made us. The ones who went thru life and made sure we existed. We feel you should have to feel what you made them hold... and in just as viseral a way as we had to experience. 

This is about ... showing the world that when we ask you to stop because it hurts ... it fucking hurts and that you don't get it. 

This is about you NOT getting to say to us "get over it," "Calm down," and "Well, this is just something you're gonna have to live with."

This is about saying... in your focus for a life of Love, but only a Love that you want, or could understand, that you caused hate, and pain, and fucking RAGE to those you disregard because YOU... CHOOSE to not try... while all we ever HAD was fucking try... 

This is Art and This is Emotional Expression. This is also Real. 

This is about
