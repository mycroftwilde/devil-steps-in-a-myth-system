General Concept - Devil Steps in a Myth System:

It is, roughly speaking, saying that we must first take agency with the reality we are woken from before we can KNOW what it is to live. 

It also overlays with the idea that a Myth System, the lens system with which we interpretate our experiences... it isn't "Truth"... and isn't really "REAL" in the way we think of the word "Real," anyway... it's a built systems interprative experience...it's a part of the human experience to create that system or to have it... and that system will always house... Inherited Devils, and the ones we create ourselves.


##

The Approach:
            
 My approach could be visualized as a sort of "scatter shot" to getting everything I need in one place. I don't want to over think it too much, so expect some grammer and spelling issues while it's being put together. I'll re-review once it's complete and correct it. 
 
 As well, the things I'm attempting to articulate could be considered sacraligous to some... I don't consider all of this to be accurate, either, it's ... more of an attempt, let's say, to build an image and then express that image.

[About the Artist](https://github.com/mycroftwilde/devil-steps-in-a-myth-system/tree/master/artist)

We must also consider that your view, and experience in what you see is through your myth system and lens... they are interpreting what my system is trying to express. To better understand the building thoughts over a lifetime, that have...solidified into this project... you should understand how I'm built to better understand this whole. 

This should also give you a better understanding of seeing another persons system, while understanding the reasons for "why" it is expressed the way that it is. 

(I'm constantly frustrated by obfuscation for no reason. Clarity doesn't diminish art.... it may, however, diminish the ego of the artist who isn't prepared, or, doesn't really know what they are saying...)
