### Devil Steps in a Myth System - General Concept:


It is, roughly speaking, saying that we must first take agency with the reality we are woken from before we can live. 

It is also overlayed with the idea that a Myth System, the lens system with which we interpretate our experiences ... isn't "Real" ... not in the way we think of the word "Real," anyway ... it's a built systems interprative experience ... it's a part of the human experience to create that system, but, that system will always house ... problems ... our Devils, if we will.  

This project is intended to represent that we must approach the things we fear, perhaps even walk the same steps of the devil himself ... in advocay for our personal agency and so that we can finally make a choice of our own.

### Caution: 

This idea, or it's approach, could be considered sacraligous to some ... I would urge you to remember the below - if you have any reactions to the things you read. 

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” 

- Frank Herbert
            (Interestingly, this was noted before exposure therapy was widely used like it is now...)

### General Approach:
            
 My approach could be visualized as a sort of "scatter shot" to getting everything I need in one place. I don't want to over think it too much, so expect some grammer and spelling issues while it's being put together. I'll re-review once it's complete and correct it. 
 
 As well, the things I'm attempting to articulate could be considered sacraligous to some ... I don't consider all of this to be accurate, either, it's ... more of an attempt, let's say, to build an image and then express that image.

#### The Artist

We must also consider that your view, and experience in what you see is through your myth system and lens ... they are interpreting what my system is trying to express. To better understand the building thoughts over a lifetime, that have ... solidified into this project ... you should understand how I'm built to better understand this whole. 

This should also give you a better understanding of seeing another persons system, while understanding the reasons for "why" it is expressed the way that it is. 

(I'm constantly frustrated by obfuscation for no reason. Clarity doesn't diminish art ... it may, however, diminish the ego of the artist who isn't prepared, or, doesn't really know what they are saying ... )
