### Devil Steps in a Myth System - General Concept:


The idea behind this statement is, roughly, we must take agency from the reality we are given before we can be truly considered "alive."

It is also overlayed with the idea that a Myth System, the lens system with which we interpretate our experiences ... it isn't "Real" ... not in the way we think of the word "Real," anyway ... it's a built systems interprative experience ... it's a part of the human experience to create that system, but, unfortunately, that system will always house ... problems ... our "Devils," if we will.  

This project is intended to represent this idea - that we must first approach the things we fear, perhaps even walk the same steps of the devil himself ... before we can finally learn to make real choices and see the world, and what OUR reality actually is.

### Caution: 

Because this idea, or it's approach, could be considered sacraligous to some I thought it best to include the below Quote by Frank Herbert.... I would urge anyone who has a negative reaction due to personal religous beliefs to remember the below. 

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” 

- Frank Herbert
            (Interestingly, this was noted before exposure therapy was widely used like it is now...)

### General Approach:
            
 My approach could be visualized as a sort of "scatter shot" to getting everything I need in one place. I don't want to over think it too much, so, essentially expect some grammer and spelling issues while it's being put together, and half finished thoughts. I'll re-review once it's complete and correct it. 
 
 As well, I don't consider all of this to be accurate, either, it's ... more of an attempt, let's say, to build an image, and then express that image, in the best way I can.

#### The Artist

We must also consider that your view, and experience in what you see, is through your myth system and lens ... and they are interpreting what my system is trying to express. To better understand the building thoughts over a lifetime, that have ... solidified into this project ... you should understand how I'm built to better understand this as a whole. 

This should also give you a better understanding of seeing another persons system and Art, while understanding the reasons for "why" it is expressed the way it is. Hopefully this should give a new audience an anchor point for art they may not have had before. Perhaps a new way to resonante? something like that.

(I'm constantly frustrated by obfuscation for no reason. Clarity doesn't diminish art ... it may, however, diminish the ego of the artist who isn't prepared, or, maybe, doesn't really know what they are saying ... )
