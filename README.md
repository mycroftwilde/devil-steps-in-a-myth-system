# Devil Steps in a Myth System

I've written the structure for this in my head ... so many different ways. Orienting the infomration for this, so that it builds properly... has been a little of a challenge... but, then again, here we are.

My brain doesn't think linerally, also, in another sense it thinks hyper-linerally... hyper-linerally but with a web's structure? something like that... 


I think it's really time to have some fun... don't you?
